\subsection{Experiment setup}

For this project, we’ll use Baidu Apollo\cite{apollo} open-source AD
system. It’s a widely-used industry-grade system equipped
with the typical MSF algorithm. We’ll also use LGSVL simulator\cite{lgsvl}, an
open-source simulator providing a virtual environment to test
AV systems. To reproduce the attacks on camera and LiDAR,
we use the Github repository\cite{msf-adv} provided by Cao \emph{et al.}. After
generating adversarial objects with the tool mentioned, we’ll
test our AV-based IF-defense\cite{if-defense} by processing the rendered 3D point cloud before feeding it into the pre-processing part in Figure

As for the evaluation metric, we will measure 1) the detection accuracy of the adversarial obstacles
, 2) the detection accuracy and false-positive of the overall obstacles, including the benign ones and adversarial ones.
